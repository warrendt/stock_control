#Stock control for an art gallery

Art galleries typically don't buy in work to sell. They will often get work in on sale or
return basis; i.e. the work is not paid for until it is sold. Any unsold work will need to
be returned to the artist at some date.

This system allows for these functions. It lets the user:

+ Record deliveries of stock
+ Record returns to artist
+ Record sales of stock
+ Record payments to the artist

It will have various reports, which will allow the gallery to see

+ Who they owe money to
+ Value of current stock etc.

The system is based on [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com "Code Igniter")
